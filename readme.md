## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyYAML
- (Other dependencies to be listed)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/tao-agent.git
   cd tao-agent
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your configuration files (see Configuration section below).

4. Run the TAO Agent:
   ```
   python tao_agent.py
   ```

## Configuration

TAO Agent uses YAML files for configuration. The main configuration file is typically `config.yaml`, but you can split your configuration into multiple files for better organization.

### Basic Structure

```yaml
base_config:
  name: "Your Workflow Name"
  version: "1.0"

workflow_engine:
  plugin_directory: "./plugins"
  default_plugin: "your_default_plugin"

plugins:
  - name: "your_plugin"
    tasks:
      - name: "task_1"
        module: "your_module"
        function: "your_function"
        parameters:
          param1: "value1"
    workflow:
      - task_1
      - task_2
```

See the `sample_config.yaml` file for a comprehensive example.

## Creating Plugins

Plugins are the core of TAO Agent's extensibility. To create a new plugin:

1. Create a new directory in the `plugins` folder.
2. Create a `config.yaml` file in your plugin directory defining tasks and workflow.
3. Implement your task functions in Python modules.

Example plugin structure:
```
plugins/
  your_plugin/
    config.yaml
    task_module.py
```

## Task Development

Tasks are the building blocks of your workflows. Each task should:

1. Adhere to the task interface defined in the configuration.
2. Implement error handling and logging.
3. Use shared utilities where appropriate.
4. Return a structured output for use in subsequent tasks.

Example task:
```python
from tao.utils import file_ops

def your_task(input_param):
    try:
        result = file_ops.process_file(input_param)
        return {"status": "success", "data": result}
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Task failed: {str(e)}")
        return {"status": "error", "message": str(e)}
```

## Error Handling

TAO Agent provides multiple levels of error handling:

1. Task-level error handling
2. Workflow-level error management
3. System-wide error policies

Configure error handling in your YAML files and implement appropriate try/except blocks in your task code.

## Logging

Logging is configured in the YAML files and should be used consistently across all tasks and plugins. Use the provided logging utility functions for standardized log formatting.

## Design Document Framework

This README sets the foundation for updating the following design documents:

1. **architectural_diagram.md**
   - Update to reflect the new plugin-based architecture
   - Illustrate the workflow engine and its interactions with plugins
   - Show the relationship between configuration files and system components

2. **call_graph.md**
   - Revise to show the flow of function calls in the new system
   - Include plugin loading and task execution processes
   - Demonstrate error handling and logging flows

3. **data_flow_diagram.md**
   - Modify to illustrate data movement through the reconfigured system
   - Show how configuration data influences task execution
   - Depict data flow between tasks and through shared utilities

4. **python_libraries.md**
   - Update the list of required libraries
   - Remove AI-related libraries (e.g., OpenAI)
   - Add new libraries for plugin management, enhanced YAML parsing, etc.

5. **sequence_diagram.md**
   - Revise to show the sequence of operations in the new system
   - Include plugin loading, configuration parsing, and task execution
   - Demonstrate how conditional logic and error handling are applied

When updating these documents, keep in mind the following key aspects of TAO Agent v2.0:

- The shift from AI-driven to rule-based, configurable logic
- The plugin-based architecture and its implications for system flexibility
- The enhanced role of YAML configuration in defining system behavior
- The improved error handling and logging mechanisms
- The use of shared utilities and task templates for consistency and efficiency

By aligning these documents with the new architecture and features of TAO Agent v2.0, we will provide a comprehensive and coherent description of the system's design and operation.
