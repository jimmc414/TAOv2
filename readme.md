## Quick Start Guide

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jimmc414/TAOv2.git
   cd tao-agentTAOv2
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a basic configuration file `my_config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   config_version: "2.2"
   name: "My First TAO Workflow"
   
   workflow:
     name: "Hello World Workflow"
     tasks:
       - name: say_hello
         plugin: core_plugin
         function: print_message
         parameters:
           message: "Hello, TAO!"
   ```

4. Run TAO:
   ```
   python TAOv2.py --config my_config.yaml
   ```

## Configuration Structure

TAO v2.0 supports two levels of configuration complexity:

1. **Complex Configuration** (`complex_config.yaml`):
   - Modular structure with references to other configuration files
   - Schema definitions for validation
   - Detailed task and step configurations
   - Advanced conditional logic and data flow management
   - Task-specific logging configurations

2. **Basic Configuration** (`basic_config.yaml`):
   - Essential configuration elements
   - Simplified workflow structure
   - Minimal plugin usage
   - Basic error handling and logging

## System Architecture

TAO v2.0 is built on a modular architecture with the following key components:

```mermaid

4. **Task Executor**: Responsible for executing individual tasks and managing their lifecycle.
5. **State Machine**: Maintains and manages the state of the workflow execution.
6. **Conditional Logic Module**: Implements rule-based decision making for dynamic workflow control.
7. **Shared Utilities**: Common functions available to all tasks and plugins.
8. **Error Handler**: Manages error detection, reporting, and recovery strategies.
9. **Logger**: Records system events, task executions, and error information.
10. **Progress Reporter**: Tracks and reports the progress of tasks and overall workflow.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jimmc414/TAOv2.git
   cd TAOv2
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your environment:
   - Copy `example.env` to `.env` and fill in the necessary environment variables.
   - Choose between `complex_config.yaml` or `basic_config.yaml` as your starting point.

4. Run TAO:
   ```
   python TAOv2.py --config your_config.yaml
   ```

## Creating and Using Plugins

Plugins are the core of TAO's extensibility. To create a new plugin:

1. Create a new Python file in the `plugins` directory (e.g., `my_plugin.py`).
2. Implement the required plugin interface:

   ```python
   from tao.base_plugin import BasePlugin

   class MyPlugin(BasePlugin):
       def initialize(self):
           # Plugin initialization code

       def execute_task(self, task_name: str, parameters: dict):
           # Task execution code

       def cleanup(self):
           # Cleanup code
   ```

3. Register your plugin in the configuration file:

   ```yaml
   plugins:
     - name: "my_plugin"
       module: "plugins.my_plugin"
       description: "Description of my plugin"
   ```

## Creating Workflows

Workflows are defined in the YAML configuration file. Here's a basic example:

```yaml
workflow:
  name: "My Workflow"
  description: "A simple workflow example"
  tasks:
    - name: task1
      plugin: my_plugin
      function: do_something
      parameters:
        param1: value1
    - name: task2
      plugin: another_plugin
      function: do_something_else
      parameters:
        param2: value2
```

For more complex workflows, refer to the `complex_config.yaml` example.

## Advanced Configuration Examples

Here's an example of a more complex workflow with conditional branching:

```yaml
workflow:
  name: "Advanced Data Processing"
  tasks:
    - name: fetch_data
      plugin: data_plugin
      function: fetch_from_api
      parameters:
        api_endpoint: "https://api.example.com/data"
    - name: process_data
      plugin: data_plugin
      function: process_json
      parameters:
        input: "{{ tasks.fetch_data.output }}"
    - name: conditional_task
      plugin: core_plugin
      function: branch
      conditions:
        - condition: "{{ tasks.process_data.output.count > 100 }}"
          true_branch: large_dataset_handler
          false_branch: small_dataset_handler
    - name: large_dataset_handler
      plugin: data_plugin
      function: handle_large_dataset
    - name: small_dataset_handler
      plugin: data_plugin
      function: handle_small_dataset
```

## Performance Considerations

To optimize the performance of your TAO workflows:

1. Use the `parallel` option for tasks that can run concurrently.
2. Implement caching mechanisms in your plugins for frequently accessed data.
3. Use generator functions for processing large datasets to minimize memory usage.
4. Profile your workflows using the built-in profiling tool:
   ```
   python tao_agent.py --config your_config.yaml --profile
   ```

## Testing and Debugging

TAO v2.0 includes a comprehensive testing framework:

1. Unit tests for individual plugins and tasks:
   ```
   python -m unittest discover tests/unit
   ```

2. Integration tests for entire workflows:
   ```
   python -m unittest discover tests/integration
   ```

3. Debug mode for detailed logging:
   ```
   python tao_agent.py --config your_config.yaml --debug
   ```

## Error Handling and Logging

TAO v2.0 provides comprehensive error handling and logging:

- Configure global and task-specific logging in the YAML configuration.
- Use the `error_handling` section in the configuration to define retry logic and fallback actions.
- Implement custom error handling in your plugins by overriding the `handle_error` method.

Example configuration:

```yaml
logging:
  global:
    level: INFO
    file: "./logs/tao_log.txt"
  tasks:
    data_processing:
      level: DEBUG

error_handling:
  global:
    max_retries: 3
    retry_delay: 60
  tasks:
    api_call:
      max_retries: 5
      retry_delay: 30
```

## Security Best Practices

1. Use environment variables for sensitive information (API keys, passwords).
2. Implement proper authentication and authorization in your plugins.
3. Regularly update TAO and its dependencies.
4. Use HTTPS for any network communications.
5. Implement input validation for all user-supplied data.
6. Regularly audit your workflows and plugins for security vulnerabilities.
