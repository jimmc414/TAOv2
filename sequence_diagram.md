## Sequence Description

1. **Workflow Initiation**
   - User starts the workflow through the UI Manager.
   - UI Manager initializes the workflow in the Workflow Engine.

2. **System Preparation**
   - Workflow Engine loads configuration data from the Configuration Manager.
   - Workflow Engine loads necessary plugins through the Plugin System.

3. **Task Execution Loop**
   For each task in the workflow:
   - Workflow Engine instructs the Task Executor to run the task.
   - Task Executor retrieves the current state from the State Machine.
   - Task Executor evaluates conditions using the Conditional Logic module.

4. **Conditional Execution**
   Depending on the evaluation results:
   - Task Executor may perform utility operations using Shared Utilities.
   - If an error occurs, it's handled by the Error Handler and logged.

5. **State and Progress Updates**
   - Task Executor updates the state in the State Machine.
   - Progress is reported to the Progress Reporter, which updates the UI.

6. **Task Completion**
   - Task Executor returns the task result to the Workflow Engine.

7. **Workflow Completion**
   - After all tasks are executed, Workflow Engine notifies UI Manager.
   - UI Manager displays the results to the User.

## Key Interactions

1. **User-System Interaction**: Primarily through the UI Manager at the start and end of the workflow.
2. **Configuration and Plugin Loading**: Handled by the Workflow Engine at the beginning of execution.
3. **Task Execution Flow**: Coordinated by the Workflow Engine, with actual execution handled by the Task Executor.
4. **State Management**: Constant interaction between Task Executor and State Machine.
5. **Conditional Logic**: Used by Task Executor to determine execution paths.
6. **Error Handling**: Errors are managed by the Error Handler and logged appropriately.
7. **Progress Reporting**: Continuous updates from Task Executor through Progress Reporter to UI.
